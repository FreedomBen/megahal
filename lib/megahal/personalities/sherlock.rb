I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.
Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe.
I see it, I deduce it.
It is simplicity itself.
Quite so.
You see, but you do not observe.  The distinction is clear.
How often?
Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point.
I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.
Peculiar--that is the very word.
What do you make of that?
There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.
This promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.
I was aware of it.
I was also aware of that.
Then, pray consult.
Let me see!
You have compromised yourself seriously.
So I have heard.
And why?
That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present.
Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.
If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.
It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.
This was quite too good to lose, Watson.
This is a very unexpected turn of affairs.
I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening.
By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.
You don't mind breaking the law?
Oh, the cause is excellent!
I was sure that I might rely on you.
There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?
That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.
Now the question is, where are we to find the photograph?
Pshaw! They did not know how to look.
I will not look.
I know where it is.
I do not wish to make a mystery. The matter was perfectly simple.
I've heard that voice before. Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.
I am Mr. Holmes.
You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson.
So I am. Very much so.
I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life.
You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right.
Your experience has been a most entertaining one.
Pray continue your very interesting statement.
I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
And what did you do then?
Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.
I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two.
As a rule, the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.
It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes.
My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.
I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!
We have at least an hour before us.
And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head.
I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.
My dear fellow, life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent.
We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.
If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outrÃ© results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.
A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect.
I have seen those symptoms before.
Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?
You interest me extremely.
You have made your position very clear to me.
It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.
It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated.
But you have no notion as to what it could have been?
One more question. How did your mother take the matter?
And your father? Did you tell him?
I fear not.
You will leave that question in my hands.
Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly.
My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?
There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!
Have you heard anything of the case?
But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home.
Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it.
I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.
Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing.
There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.
My dear fellow, I know you well.
I think that it is very probable.
In what way?
Yes, certainly.
You have been of material assistance to me.
Indeed! That is interesting.
You are right, you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.
Oh, tut, tut! I have no time!
It has been a case of considerable interest.
I don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice.
Light a cigar and let me expound.
It is obvious.
Quite so.
I am glad to hear you say so.
It may not come to that.
Well, it is not for me to judge you.
I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.
God help us!
Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?
I do not encourage visitors.
That is easily got.
That is not always so easy.
He said too much.
I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman.
It is true that I have been generally successful.
None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.
You fill me with interest.
Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.
Your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened.
Thank you. Pray proceed.
What have you done?
Nothing?
You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.
Ah!
Why did you come to me, and, above all, why did you not come at once?
And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act.
There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once.
Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger.
That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.
I think, Watson, that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.
There can be no question as to their nature.
Excellent. We have already a clue.
Does that suggest anything?
More than that. It is probable.
Ah! I feared as much. How was it done?
That hurts my pride, Watson.
It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride.
They must be cunning devils.
So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with you.
Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.
I suppose, Watson, that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.
Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently.
You have a grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant.
Pray continue your narrative.
It certainly sounds feasible.
Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner.
Was the window open?
A call for help, you thought?
But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?
And you thought he was pulled back?
You did not see anyone else in the room?
Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?
I want to test a little theory of mine.
It has been in some points a singular case.
I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.
I should like to see him very much.
No, I think that I'll take it.
No crime, but a very great error has been committed.
I reached this one by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag.
I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.
Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results.
The matter is a perfectly trivial one, but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.
My dear fellow, there lies the problem.
Only as much as we can deduce.
Precisely.
You know my methods.
On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.
Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?
I cannot tell.
By all means.
Good-evening. It's a cold night.
That's no good.
What have you to say now?
I think that I could be of assistance to you.
My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know.
Excuse me, I know everything of it.
I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.
Very sorry to knock you up, Watson, but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
You must not fear. We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt.
Pray be precise as to details.
Perfectly so.
Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.
Very strange!
Perhaps I have.
I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.
No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause.
It is very kind of you.
No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.
Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement.
My dear Watson, you evidently did not realize my meaning when I said that this man may be taken as being quite on the same intellectual plane as myself.
I think that I may go so far as to say, Watson, that I have not lived wholly in vain.
In over a thousand cases I am not aware that I have ever used my powers upon the wrong side.
Of late I have been tempted to look into the problems furnished by nature rather than those more superficial ones for which our artificial state of society is responsible.
I think that you know me well enough, Watson, to understand that I am by no means a nervous man.
You have probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?
As you are aware, Watson, there is no one who knows the higher criminal world of London so well as I do.
My dear Watson, Professor Moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet.
My dear Watson, you have not even condescended to say good-morning.
Have you seen the morning paper, Watson?
We must plan what we are to do about Moriarty now.
Isn't it gorgeous! What do you think of it?
No, it's not quite so bad as that.
I confess that I am surprised and disappointed.  I expected something definite by this time.
You can do what you will, but I must remain on guard.
I am very anxious that I should use the knowledge which I possess in order to insure that justice be done.
Will you associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that I should act independently?
In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay.
You have acted with great discretion.
That is the problem which we are now about to solve.
Not a doubt of that.
What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence.
The question is, what can you make people believe that you have done.
I would not have missed the investigation for anything.
There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it.
Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise.
I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance.
In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards.
That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much.
In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected.
There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.
I hardly expected that you would.
Let me see if I can make it clearer.
Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be.
There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result.
Didn't I tell you so when we started?
I have investigated many crimes, but I have never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature.
As long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some indentation, some abrasion, some trifling displacement which can be detected by the scientific searcher.
I think that both inferences are permissible.
Excellent! What more?
Dear me, it is certainly a very interesting case.
I fear there is some dark ending to our quest.
Come, Watson, come! The game is afoot.
At present I am, as you know, fairly busy, but I propose to devote my declining years to the composition of a textbook, which shall focus the whole art of detection into one volume.
What the deuce is it to me?
I have a kind of intuition that way.
Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes.
You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.
 Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work.
Observation with me is second nature.
From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.
I have no time for trifles.
Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as well.
It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it.
If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact.
It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.
We come now, however, to a point which is of importance.
There is a further point, however, which is subtler and of greater interest.
I could see that you were commiserating me over my weakness.
I was sleepy before you came. I am quite wakeful now.
I have heard nothing of it.
Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?
But it is not the print of a monkey.
That, also, is still obscure.
But we have learned a good deal, you perceive.
So now, my dear fellow, you see exactly how we stand and why it is I want you.
You may be sure that I took some precautions.
That's what I want to ascertain.
